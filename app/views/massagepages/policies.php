    <h1>Our Policies</h1>
	<p>These policies are guidelines for your information and safety. We adhere to them as much as possible, and additions and changes are made as the situations warrant. By consenting to care, you agree to abide by our policies.</p>
    <h2>Cancellation and Missed Appointments</h2>
	<p>We honor a 24 hour cancellation policy that requests that you contact us 24 hours before your scheduled appointment if you want to cancel or reschedule. If you do not show up to the appointment, it is considered a cancellation without notice. You will be allowed one missed appointment without being billed. After one missed appointment, you will be billed, except in case of emergencies such as death in the family.</p>
    <h2>Tardiness</h2>
	<p>All appointments should start and end at the appointed times. If you arrive less than 15 minutes late, your session will still end at the scheduled time, and you will be charged the full price. It is at our discretion whether or not to accept a client who arrives 15 minutes late.</p>
	<p>If you are more than five minutes late, we will give you a call to see if you are coming. If you arrive 30 minutes late, the session is considered a missed appointment.</p>
    <h2>Conduct and Behavior</h2>
	<p>All services provided by this practice are strictly therapeutic. No sexual conversation or behavior will be tolerated by either the massage therapist or the client at any time. Any behavior or discussion of a sexual or erotic nature will result in immediate termination of the massage session. Massage sessions terminated for inappropriate behavior will be charged the full session fee, and this practice will be closed to you with no referral.</p>
    <h3>Draping and Modesty</h3>
	<p>You will be draped throughout the massage session; only the area that is being treated will be uncovered.</p>
	<p>A full body massage does not include massaging of any breast tissue or genital areas; these areas will always remain draped throughout the session.</p>
	<p>You are requested to undress to your comfort level. Please consider that massage therapy is most effective with skin contact. Areas covered by clothing may not receive effective therapeutic work.</p>
	<h3>Termination of Service</h3>
	<p>Both the client and the therapist have the individual right to terminate the session at any time.</p>
	<h3>Hygiene</h3>
	<p>Massage therapy involves the use of touch, and may at times include the use of oils, lotions, or creams. Coming to your massage therapy session with a clean body is imperative for the health and safety of both the client and massage therapist. Personal hygiene is mutually respected on both the part of the client and the massage therapist. Should either part fail to uphold their hygiene responsibilities, services for that session will be postponed.</p>
	<h3>Substance Use</h3>
	<p>Alcohol or drugs and massage DO NOT MIX. Massage therapist and client both will refrain from alcohol and drug use for at least 12 hours prior to the massage session. This ensures that the effects of any substances that particularly alter psychology or physiology are eliminated.</p>
	<p>In the case of prescription medication for health conditions, we will work with your medication schedule to tailor the massage session to your situation.</p>
	<h3>Presence of Other Parties</h3>
	<p>Clients 18 years or younger must be accompanied by and have the consent of a parent or guardian. Any client can request a friend or relative to accompany them in the massage session if this will help the client feel more comfortable. The person accompanying must agree to not disrupt the session and to behave appropriately at all times.</p>
	<p>Animals and pets are prohibited in the massage session unless the client requires assistance from a service animal.</p>
    <h2>Referrals</h2>
	<p>We appreciate referrals to our massage practice. Your information will always remain confidential and will never be shared with other clients, including those you have referred or who have referred you.</p>
    <h2>Background Music and Environment</h2>
	<p>We aim to create a comfortable, scent-free environment for your session. You have the right to request no background music, or you may bring the music you would like to play. You may also request lighting changes, or any other reasonable change that would make your session comfortable.</p>
    <h2>Payment</h2>
	<p>Payment is required in full at the time of service. Gratuities are not included in the price of service and are not expected but always appreciated. We reserve the right to raise fees with some prior notice. No refunds will be given for services rendered.</p>
	<p>At this time payment is accepted in cash or check only. A receipt will be provided for all payments.</p>
    <h2>Health History and Informed Consent</h2>
	<p>It is important that you honestly and accurately disclose any injuries, surgeries, illnesses, and contagious conditions on the health history form you will be given to fill out prior to your treatment. This policy is for your safety, as massage is contraindicated (not recommended) when certain conditions or illnesses are present in the body. We may decline to treat you or refer you to your physician if any health concerns arise, or if you need to obtain clearance from a physician prior to receiving massage therapy.</p>
	<p>Please note that massage is not appropriate when infectious diseases such as cold or influenza are present. Massage increases the risk of contagion and may be uncomfortable for the client. It is up to our discretion whether to give massage to a client with an infectious disease.</p>
	<p>By signing your health history form, you attest to the accuracy and thoroughness of the information, and you give consent to receive massage therapy. Remember: it is your choice to have massage therapy; you may choose to end the session at any time.</p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
	<h3>Personal Health History and Records</h3>
	<p>All personal information, including health history, session information, assessments and notes, is kept strictly confidential. No other party other than the client and the therapist may be allowed to view or discuss the information in these documents.</p>
    <h3>Oral or Other Communication</h3>
	<p>Any discussion between the client and therapist during the session, over the phone, or through email remains strictly confidential. The session therapy plan and the techniques used during the session are also considered confidential. We never disclose your information to other parties without your written consent. Other clients' information will never be shared with you without their written consent, even if the client is a relative or close friend.</p>
	<p>In some cases a physician may request copies of therapy records. These will not be released without your written consent.</p>
    <h2>Liability and Disclaimer</h2>
	<p>By signing the health history and consent and contract for care forms, the client releases A Thousand Petals Massage Therapy and the massage therapist from any and all past, present, and future liability relating to massage therapy and bodywork.</p>
	<p>Please read our <a href="http://ourdisclaimer.com/?i=A%20Thousand%20Petals">Website Disclaimer</a>.</p>
