	<h1>Clinical Rehabilitative Massage</h1>
    <p>Soft tissue injuries are more common than we realize. Sometimes we aren't even aware of painful areas until they are touched. Whether or not you have a known soft tissue condition, we can help you restore the fluidity and balance. Clinical Rehabilitative Massage provides the in-depth attention that you need to address the injury and all the affected tissue systems. You can expect a thorough intake of your situation, including posture and functional analysis, a variety of massage techniques from different modalities, and suggestions for your self-care outside of the session room--all informed by a clear understanding of anatomy and tissue depth, and tailored to your particular condition. Your discomfort will melt away as your body repairs itself in the most optimal way with Clinical Rehabilitative Massage.</p>
    <p>If you receive regular massage, you probably know that regular circulatory massage can give you the awareness of an injured area before the injury escalates or complicates, and that it can even remedy minor injuries. But sometimes we are afflicted by age-old injuries that need special attention, or sudden accidents that we would like to heal quickly. A more clinical approach may be necessary to attend to traumatized tissue.</p>
    <p>Some conditions that indicate massage:</p>
    <ul><li>Muscle Strains</li><li>Ligament Sprains</li><li>Bursitis</li><li>Tendonitis</li><li>Tendinosis</li><li>Trigger Points</li><li>Tender Points</li><li>Tennis Elbow (lateral epicondylitis)</li><li>Golfer Elbow (medial epicondylitis)</li><li>Reduced range of motion</li><li>Postural deviations</li></ul>
    <p>If you are already seeking treatment for an injury, we can work with your health care provider to integrate massage therapy as part of your plan. Book a free consultation to talk about these concerns, so we can create the best plan for your care.</p>
