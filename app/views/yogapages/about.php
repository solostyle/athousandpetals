   	<h3>Yoga and Meditation Instruction</h3>
	<p>As a student and practitioner of the internal arts for many years, I have come to appreciate the value of consistent practice on our innate healing powers. The Chinese Qi Gong tradition was my first formal introduction to meditation, which I have integrated with the Yoga tradition. I also incorporate the principles of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga into my Hatha Yoga practice. I believe that my dedicated personal practice of these arts has improved all aspects of my life, and it contributes to the joy I have for teaching. As most of my understanding comes from direct experience, I guide my students to seek knowledge through their own experience. My scientific and experiential understanding of human anatomy informs my instruction, and my training as a massage therapist gives me a creative, therapeutic approach that focuses on your individual situation.</p>
